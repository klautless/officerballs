# tambourine
a collection of several *permanent* spawners which will last until you remove them.  
if you're host, they're shared. elsewhere, they're private to you.  
can now be used safely in cove servers (no longer sending spawns to other players when not host)  
  
the creator of 'stamps' has tried to block people from using their mod alongside mine, despite the fact that it doesn't create an actual incompatibility of any kind. because of this, i have renamed tambourine's files so their filter won't lie to you if you want to use both (unless they block it again). see: https://github.com/unpaid-intern/StampMod/blob/1b8a608b938c69864900fbc8cfba4807b73c6d53/main.gd#L330 
  
spawners included: meteor, ripple, permanent bait, void portal.
