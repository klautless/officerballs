let's start by purchasing some ingredients! we'll need these for any recipe other than sashimi. we want to make rolls!  
bought some? great! now try cooking the rice at a campfire!

the rice cooker will run automatically, and each batch will take 10 seconds. you can run this while you cut fish if you so choose!

great! let's collect it and move on to the next step. first, let's find somewhere comfy to work...  
  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klautless/officerballs/refs/heads/main/sushi%20time%20guide/Screenshot%202025-01-31%20191032.png)  
  
this spot will do nicely! let's put down a table and get to work!

oh yes!! the season-o-matic 4000! this year's model! bells and whistles! holy tom cruise!

we can just click the buttons and follow along. when we've seasoned enough rice for our sushi we can press 'stop seasoning' and move ahead!

aw jeez, we're out of usable fish. we can't make sushi out of just any fish, after all!  
any fish that qualify and aren't favorited can be chosen, so remember to check first!  
  
*after some fishing...*

welcome to sushinator premium. the minigames here just require you to follow through the buttons. simple enough, eh?  
  
![](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/klautless/officerballs/refs/heads/main/sushi%20time%20guide/Screenshot%202025-01-31%20191359.png)  
  
let's start with our basic nigiri - just sushi rice and fish. press select fish.  
  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klautless/officerballs/refs/heads/main/sushi%20time%20guide/Screenshot%202025-01-31%20191413.png)  
  
this is our bento box. for now it will only show us what we can use in our recipes. we'll see this again later on!  
  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klautless/officerballs/refs/heads/main/sushi%20time%20guide/Screenshot%202025-01-31%20191428.png)  
  
this one will do!  
  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klautless/officerballs/refs/heads/main/sushi%20time%20guide/Screenshot%202025-01-31%20191444.png)  
  
now our sushinator app lets us prepare the nigiri.  
*a few button presses later...*  
  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klautless/officerballs/refs/heads/main/sushi%20time%20guide/Screenshot%202025-01-31%20191503.png)  
  
beautiful!

now, when we move to making wrapped nigiri, we can choose to start prep from regular nigiri or make it from scratch.  
this is easy! let's move on to something more complicated.  
  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klautless/officerballs/refs/heads/main/sushi%20time%20guide/Screenshot%202025-01-31%20191551.png)  
  
when making rolls, you'll select three pieces of sashimi. you can make any combine any fish here and make your own special rolls.  
let's get sta-  
  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klautless/officerballs/refs/heads/main/sushi%20time%20guide/Screenshot%202025-01-31%20191614.png)  
  
oh! we're missing ingredients. make sure to buy and prep enough!  
  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klautless/officerballs/refs/heads/main/sushi%20time%20guide/Screenshot%202025-01-31%20191650.png)  
  
that's better!  
rolling is different from the other minigames, in that you only have one button, which will change its function throughout the roll.  
  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klautless/officerballs/refs/heads/main/sushi%20time%20guide/Screenshot%202025-01-31%20191712.png)  
  
beautiful!

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klautless/officerballs/refs/heads/main/sushi%20time%20guide/Screenshot%202025-01-31%20191754.png)  
  
and there's our roll! we get three pieces every time we make a roll.  
  
now would be a nice time for a break! let's have something to eat.  
  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klautless/officerballs/refs/heads/main/sushi%20time%20guide/Screenshot%202025-01-31%20191809.png)  
  
interacting with our picnic blanket will have us sit down and open up our main bento box.  
let's apply some filters - we really only want to eat that roll right now!

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klautless/officerballs/refs/heads/main/sushi%20time%20guide/Screenshot%202025-01-31%20191913.png)  
  
wow, i don't know about this one... it looks kind of poisonous...  
  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klautless/officerballs/refs/heads/main/sushi%20time%20guide/Screenshot%202025-01-31%20191928.png)  
  
bottom's up!  
  
  
now, what should we do with all this leftover nigiri?  
  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klautless/officerballs/refs/heads/main/sushi%20time%20guide/Screenshot%202025-01-31%20192013.png)  
  
here at the vending machine, we can export our sushi to all the visitors of pawprint point. some of our goods can fetch a pretty penny, depending on what level their buffs are and what fish you use!  
  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klautless/officerballs/refs/heads/main/sushi%20time%20guide/Screenshot%202025-01-31%20192032.png)  
  
what the hell?!? $3900?!?  
  
  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klautless/officerballs/refs/heads/main/sushi%20time%20guide/Screenshot%202025-01-31%20192102.png)  
  
i hope that you enjoy sushi time as much as i enjoyed creating it!
