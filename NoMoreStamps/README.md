# no more stamps  
a mod which enables you to take control over auto-pasted images in your sessions.  
you'll crash if you try to spawn a stamp, but why would you be doing that if you're downloading this?  
  
now comes with a full-fledged menu. please view instructions below!  
  
## settings instructions  
1. equip a chalk eraser  
2. press alt+q to select between general settings, auto-hide settings, (host only) auto kick settings, and unblocking settings  
3. alt+scroll wheel to see parameters within a menu--  
4. alt+e to apply/toggle/etc.  
  
  
at this time, settings do not save between game restarts (will come in a later patch) - by default, auto-hide is on for gifs only.
