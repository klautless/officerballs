# fish exchange
custom gambling, anywhere.  
watch other players win and lose in your notifications and lul or W them.  
  
includes basic stats tracking - each player will save an individual leaderboard of both theirs and other players rolls through them. players can check their net winnings, lifetime jackpots, etc, by including the word "stats" in their mail.  
(if you host a recurring lobby, W)
## details / instructions
when players (including yourself) mail you fish, it will automatically weigh the fish submitted, roll, and mail back fish. there are dozens of variables on top of pure random rolling:  
  
1. the quality of fish submitted (normal thru alpha);  
2. the difficulty of a given catch provides a bonus to the weight;  
3. if a catch is rare (i.e. golden bass or manta) it adds significantly to the quality.  
  
each fish has a chance to be lost, or to yield more. originally this capped at 20 fish, but you can now earn up 200 at a time in the instance of a hyper-rare MEGA jackpot.  

each time you join a lobby, you refresh the global pity system. what is the global pity system? for each roll fish exchange produces, it measures the net win/loss ($) of that roll, and adds that to the global pity system. to explain it briefly, the more that people lose, the better chances EVERYONE has to win. this is reported to you in the mailouts as it accumulates.  
  
there is additionally an individual (per-player) pity system which works to a smaller degree, and is hidden.  

mail yourself with the word "stats" to check how you're doing, or "toggle" to disable the system until you turn it back on. the system is on by default, and if you disable it, it will stay disabled until either re-enabled or the game is closed.
