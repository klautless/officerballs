# the tambourine
a collection of several *permanent* spawners which will respawn at fixed positions indefinitely.  
if you're host, they're shared. elsewhere, they're private to you.  
can now be used safely in cove servers (no longer sending spawns to other players when not host)  

  
spawners included: meteor, ripple, permanent bait, void portal.
## instructions
equip a tambourine-  
alt + scroll wheel will select from spawns  
alt + left click will place them  
(for the rippler, press alt + e to enable/disable it, and alt + left click will lock its position)
