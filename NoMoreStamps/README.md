# no more stamps  
a mod which enables you to take control over auto-pasted images in your sessions.  
you'll crash if you try to spawn a stamp, but why would you be doing that if you're downloading this?  
  
please note: when joining a dedicated/cove/etc server, no more stamps may false flag the host for playing a gif. this is because, seemingly, those servers send all the chalk history rather than just the current images. you may need to disable the system prior to joining one!
  
now comes with a full-fledged menu. all settings save after 15 seconds of any changes made. please view instructions below!  
  
## settings instructions  
1. equip a chalk eraser  
2. press alt+q to select between general settings, auto-hide settings, (host only) auto kick settings, and unblocking settings  
3. alt+scroll wheel to see parameters within a menu--  
4. alt+e to apply/toggle/etc.  
  
auto-hide: when a player is added to this list, you will no longer receive chalk updates from them until/unless you manually remove them. these individual settings all default to off and are built in separately from normal hiding/blocking.
